\documentclass[journal]{IEEEtran}
\usepackage{blindtext}
\usepackage{graphicx, amsmath, amssymb, epstopdf}

% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
\usepackage{graphicx}





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
%\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley and Jeff Goldberg.
% This package may be useful when used in conjunction with IEEEtran.cls'
% captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that submissions
% have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.3.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% For subfigure.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfigure\subfigure
% \renewcommand{\subfigure}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfigure[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat/subfig command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
The project aims to explore machine learning methods to predict a movie's critical success prior 
to it's release, i.e. based solely on metadata available about the movie. The code for this project 
can be found at \texttt{\url{https://github.com/jcnnghm/cs221-project}}
\end{abstract}



\section{Introduction}
The movie industry generates multi-billion dollars in revenue and most movies
cost millions of dollars to create.  However, not all movies are successes.
With such high risk and large amounts of money involved, it would be useful to
be able to predict the success of a movie before it is released. In this
project, we try to predict the critical success of a movie, as shown by user
ratings on IMDb, based solely on metadata about a movie available prior to it's
release.

\subsection{Progress summary}
\blindtext

\section{Dataset}
Our dataset is the list of all movies from IMDb that fulfill the following properties
\begin{itemize}
	\item Released in the US
	\item Generated gross earnings in the US
	\item Has at least 1,000 user votes to rate the movie
\end{itemize}

\par After pruning the database of 3 million entries, we are left with 9888
movies which is a reasonable number for our algorithm sot run on. Limiting the
data to movies with a reasonable number of user votes also ensures that the
rating data is not too noisy. We save 20\% of the data for testing, and use the
rest for development.

\scalebox{0.55}{\includegraphics{ratings.eps}}

\section{System design}
Our system is composed of a feature creator system, a snapshot of the IMDb dataset,
and a variety of learning algorithms that operate on the information exported by
the feature creator.  The feature creator provides a framework that allows sub-component
feature extractors to interact with the IMDb dataset, stored in MySQL.  The feature 
creator calls each extractor in turn for each of the movies we've selected for our
dev and test sets, and merges their output features into a sparse feature vector for
each movie.  The feature vectors are stored in JSON so that they can be easily
post-processed for use with different algorithms. \\

\includegraphics[width=6cm]{charts/system.png}

Each algorithm is responsible for transforming the data to the format that it requires.
The neural network, for example, converts the sparse vectors from the feature creator
into a dense representation that can be consumed by FANN, a neural network library.  Each
component is modular, so the output of some algorithms can potentially be combined with others.

\section{Features}
The feature creator system extracts raw features, and then combines some features with others,
like actors with directors, to form compound "combination" features.  In total, there are about 192,000
unique features without combined features for our data set.  With combined features, that number 
balloons to over 800,000.

\scalebox{0.55}{\includegraphics{charts/features_without_cross_chart.eps}}

\scalebox{0.55}{\includegraphics{charts/features_with_cross_chart.eps}}

When represented sparsely, the feature size without combinations is about 53MB, and 82MB with combinations.  The same data represented
densely consumes approximately 3.5GB and 14GB respectively, indicating that many of the features are not associated with many movies.  Features are associated with an average of 8 movies, skewed heavily to the left. \\

\scalebox{0.50}{\includegraphics{charts/movies_per_feature.eps}}
 \\ \\

We plan to prune out features that are very specific to reduce the iteration time for our 
algorithms and the likelihood of over-fitting.  We have also started to consider 
using principal component analysis (PCA) to further reduce our data sizes.

\textbf{Initial Features (Remove this):}

\begin{align*}
        \{\ \ &\\
        &"Lasseter,John\_producer": 1,\\
        &"Luckey,Bud\_actor": 1,\\

        \}\ \ &
\end{align*}

\subsection{Cast}
The cast feature extractor generates indicator features for each
cast and crew member associated with a film, for each job they 
performed.  An individual could potentially appear more than once,
if they performed different jobs, for example, if they were both
an actor and director.

\begin{align*}
        \{ \ \ & \\
        &"Lasseter,John\_producer": 1,\\
        &"Luckey,Bud\_actor": 1,\\
        &"Klein,Sebastian\_actor": 1,\\
        &"Cummings,Jim\_actor": 1,\\
        &"Mitchell,Nicole\_writer": 1,\\
        \} \ \ &
\end{align*}

\subsection{Genre}
Genre features are indicator features that are activated for each
genre associated with a movie in the IMDb dataset.

\begin{align*}
        \{\ \ &\\
        &"genre\_Family": 1,\\
        &"genre\_Comedy": 1,\\
        &"genre\_Animation": 1,\\
        \}\ \ &
\end{align*}

\subsection{Keywords}
Keyword features are indicator features that are activated for
each searchable tag that is associated with a movie in the
IMDb dataset.

\begin{align*}
        \{\ \ &\\
        &"character-name-in-title": 1,\\
        &"sequel": 1,\\
        &"rabbit": 1,\\
        &"friendship": 1,\\
        &"tiger": 1,\\
        \}\ \ &
\end{align*}

\section{Learning algorithms}

\subsection{Neural Network}
The neural network is implemented using the Fast Artificial Neural Network (FANN)
api.  With two hidden layers, with 20 neurons in the first and 10 in the second, 
we have achieved a test error rate of 0.012156, when the rating is represented as a
number between 0 and 1.0, corresponding to an average error of approximately 1.1 out of 10.  

The neural network is slow to learn, so we plan to reduce the number of features so we can
iterate more quickly.  In addition, we plan to tune the network topology once we're able
to achieve acceptable iteration speeds.
